## Project Overview
This project implements a scalable, microservices-based financial transaction system, designed to showcase advanced software engineering practices in the fintech domain. It demonstrates expertise in Java, Spring Boot, event-driven architecture, and cloud-native technologies.

## Key Features
- Real-time transaction processing with high throughput
- Robust account management and balance tracking
- Sophisticated fraud detection system
- Comprehensive transaction history and reporting
- Seamless integration with external payment systems (simulated)
- High availability and fault tolerance

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud
- **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
- **Microservices:** 
  - Transaction Service
  - Account Service
  - Authentication Service
  - Notification Service
  - API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
- **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka
- **Caching:** Redis
- **Databases:** 
  - PostgreSQL (transactional data)
  - MongoDB (analytical data)
- **Security:** OAuth2, JWT
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Architecture
Our system follows a microservices architecture, emphasizing loose coupling and high cohesion. Key architectural features include:

- Event-driven design using Apache Kafka for inter-service communication
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern for optimized read/write operations
- API Gateway for centralized request handling and routing
- Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms for enhanced resilience
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance

For a detailed architecture diagram, please refer to the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) file.

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-transaction-system.git
   cd financial-transaction-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - Java 17
   - Apache Maven
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
   - Helm

3. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Start the local development environment:
   ```
   ./scripts/start-local-env.sh
   ```

5. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [GETTING_STARTED.md](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) file.

## Development
We follow these development practices:

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Code reviews for all pull requests
- Gitflow workflow for version control
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

For more information on our development process, coding standards, and best practices, please refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) file.

## Testing
Our testing strategy includes:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests to ensure system scalability

To run the tests locally:
```
mvn test
```

For integration tests:
```
mvn verify
```

## Deployment
We use a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. The deployment process includes:

1. Building Docker images for each microservice
2. Pushing images to a container registry
3. Deploying to Kubernetes using Helm charts

Our `pom.xml` files are configured to work with the `dockerfile-maven-plugin` for building Docker images.

For detailed deployment instructions and production considerations, please refer to the [DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) file.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
- Custom dashboards for key business and technical metrics

For more information on how to access and use our monitoring tools, please refer to the [MONITORING.md](./docs/MONITORING.md) file.
